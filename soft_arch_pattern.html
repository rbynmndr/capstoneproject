                        <p class="first-paragraph">Just like the architecture of a building, software architecture describes the design and collection of components into systems that make up the building blocks of software. Software architecture explains the structural composition of the software program and the interactions between the elements. The principle that defines the software organization schema for these software systems is called an architectural pattern.
                        </p>
                        <p>The architectural pattern captures the design structures of numerous systems and software pieces in order for them to be reused. Over the course of producing software code, developers experience identical issues several times across a project, the organisation, and their careers. One solution is to develop design patterns that provide engineers with a reusable technique to handle these difficulties, allowing software engineers to get the same structural result for a specific project.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5">There are various software architecture patterns that are commonly used in software development.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-3">Microservices Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Microservice architecture is an approach to software development that involves breaking down a large, monolithic application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice performs a specific function and communicates with other microservices using well-defined <a class="yellow" href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/" target="_blank">APIs</a>.</p>
                        <p>The microservices architecture uses several design patterns: Aggregator pattern, API gateway design pattern, chain of responsibility pattern, branch pattern, and asynchronous messaging design pattern. Each approach provides a method to manipulate data to produce services.</p>
                        <p>AWS uses a microservices architecture to build cloud-based applications. This architecture pattern enables AWS to break down complex applications into smaller, more manageable services, which can be easily scaled and deployed independently.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-3">Layered Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Layered architecture is a software design pattern that involves breaking down an application into multiple layers, each responsible for a specific function. The layers are organized in a hierarchical manner, such that when a user initiates an input, such as clicking a button, the presentation layer sends messages to the lower layer, the application layer, which, in turn, calls the business layer, then the data access layer that accesses the database.</p>
                        <p>Layered architecture patterns are found in many e-commerce web applications and desktop applications. It is also useful for applications that need to be built quickly and for enterprise applications that need to adopt traditional IT processes. Furthermore, a layered pattern is ideal for applications that require strict standards of testability.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-3">Service-Oriented Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Service-oriented architecture enables interaction between remote application components. Services are abstract, loosely connected, and independent of language. Interfaces allow applications to get access to them. Instead of starting from scratch, developers may leverage existing services. Since services may be deployed across numerous servers, service-oriented architecture is commonly employed in distributed systems. 
                            SOA is implemented using a range of technologies and standards, such as SOAP, REST, XML, and WSDL. These technologies enable services to communicate with each other across different platforms and languages.</p>
                        <p>In SOA, each service performs a specific function, such as retrieving customer data, processing a payment, or generating a report. Services communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces, which specify the data format, protocols, and operations that are supported. SOA typically involves several key components, including:</p>
